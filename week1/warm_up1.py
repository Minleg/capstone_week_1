Write a program that asks for your name and the month you were born in
Your program should print 
A greeting to you, using your name
A message with the number of letters in your name
A 'Happy birthday month!' message if you were born in January
Bonus question â€“ can you detect if the month entered is the same as the current month, no matter when you run the program?
