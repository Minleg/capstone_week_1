"""
Part 3
- new concept
Python's dataclass remove a lot of the
boilerplate* from class definitions
â€¢ Give you __init__, __str__ methods for free

boilerplate - Standard code that is included in many
places and is usually very boring to write,
e.g. constructors that simply set values, get
and set methods, toString/__str__
methods...
